# Overview

This project is to analyze whether male and female make the same amount of purchase on Black Friday via a hypothesis test with a data set that contains the transactions made in a retail store on the Black Friday.

It follows the data analysis methodology shown below.

A specific inferential question to be addressed by this project:

> Is the amount of purchase made by male different from that made by female during Black Friday?

In this project, we defined our null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. We wrote R scripts to clean, visualize and analyze the data set. Then we produced a final report with the decision based on the asymptotic theory and a t-test.

This project repository includes data, scripts, documents and results.

# Data Source

The data set we use for this project is [BlackFriday.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday)(5 MB), which contains over 500,000 observations about the Black Friday sales in a retail store. It involves different kinds of numerical variables, such as `purchase`, and categorical variables, such as `gender`. This dataset is originally used for people to make a better understanding of customer purchase behaviour.

##### Acknowledgements

The data set is downloaded from Kaggle.com ([download link](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday)). It
originally comes from a competition hosted by `Analytics Vidhya`.

---
To read the first 5 lines from `BlackFriday.csv`, we run the following script in R. The output is shown in below image.

```
Rscript src/00_read_raw_data.R data/BlackFriday.csv 5
```

# Usage

The data analysis in this project comprises of 5 steps, including cleaning data, visualizing data, analyzing data, generating results and generating a final report, as shown below.

We started with cleaning data via R script `01_clean_data.R`, which takes two arguments, a file path that points to the raw data and another file path that specifies where to store the output from the script. Then we performed exploratory data analysis via R script `02_visualize_data.R`. This script loads the tidy data generated by the first script and generates a group of figures to show any patterns in the data set. In the third R script `03_analyze_data.R`, we based on asymptotic theory to calculate sampling estimates and run t-test. The results were stored in csv files in `results` folder. After that, we used `04_generate_final_result.R` to visualize these results and save these figures in `imgs` folder. In the end, we created a R Markdown file `report.Rmd` which includes all information mentioned above and is rendered into a final report in .md format in `doc` folder.

We use Makefile to organize the execution of the above mentioned Rscripts. To execute the data analysis, we can start a Command Prompt in the project `root` directory and run the following commands step by step.
```
# step 1 - clean data and generate tidy data set
make data/BlackFriday_tidy.csv

# step 2 - run exploratory data analysis and save three plots
make imgs/gender_bar.png imgs/purch_dist.png imgs/gender_pur_hist.png

# step 3 - run CLT-based estimation and hypothesis test,
# save analysis results into two csv files
make results/blackfriday_est.csv results/t_test_result.csv

# step 4 - make plots to visualize analysis results
make imgs/errorbar.png imgs/tdist.png

# step 5 - Render R Markdown file to generate project report
make doc/report.md
```

Or, we can simply run below one command, which will automatically go through above mentioned five steps.

```
make all
```

If, after we have finished some or all of the steps, we want to re-run the analysis, we can execute below command to remove the files generated by any or all of the scripts. Then we can go through above mentioned steps again.
```
# clean all outputs
make clean
```
